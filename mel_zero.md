Step 1 - Create catalog
-----------------------

- Arrange moles by physical region, some basic anatomy is useful here.
- Where there are a lot of moles near each other it's a good idea to arrange them into 'constellations'. This should make it easier to assign unambiguous names to the individual moles.

An example arrangement:
- LeftArm
  - Forearm
    - WristHorse
      - Nose
      - Ear
      - FrontLeg
      - BackLeg
    - InsideArmScorpion
       - LeftClaw
       - RightClaw
       - Head
       - Stinger
    - BigMoleNearElbow
- ...
