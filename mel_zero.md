No executables, just documentation of how to create and maintain a mole catalog manually using commonly available software and hardware.

Pre-requisites
--------------

This just details the author's particular setup, many substitutions are possible.

- Hardware: iPhone
- Hardware: Veho VMS-004 USB Microscope
- Hardware: MacBook Air
- MacOSX app: Photo Booth
- MacOSX app: Dropbox
- iPhone app: Skitch
- iPhone app: Diptic
- iPhone app: SimpleResize
- iPhone app: Dropbox
- Dropbox account linking an empty 'moles' folder on MacBook Air and iPhone

Step 1 - Create catalog
-----------------------

- Arrange moles by physical region, some basic anatomy is useful here.
- Where there are a lot of moles near each other it's a good idea to arrange them into 'constellations'. This should make it easier to assign unambiguous names to the individual moles.

An example arrangement:
- LeftArm
  - Forearm
    - WristHorse
      - Nose
      - Ear
      - FrontLeg
      - BackLeg
    - InsideArmScorpion
       - LeftClaw
       - RightClaw
       - Head
       - Stinger
    - BigMoleNearElbow
- ...

For each mole and constellation, you'll want to make an identifying image for future reference. It's easy to forget which is which later.

### Adding a constellation of moles

To add an identifying image for a constellation of moles to your catalog in Dropbox:

1. Take a "context image" of the constellation using the iPhone, this should show some surrounding features clearly. This allows you to quickly identify the general area.
2. Use Skitch on the iPhone to draw a box around constellation on the context image.
3. Take a "detail image" of the constellation, this should clearly show each mole in the constellation.
4. Use Skitch to draw lines between the moles in the constellation on the detail image. The lines should make a figure that agrees with the name you have chosen for the constellation.
5. Use Diptic on the iPhone to arrange the context image and the detail image side-by-side. This new image is the identifying image for the constellation.
6. Use SimpleResize on the iPhone to reduce the image size to something managable.
7. Use Dropbox on the iPhone to upload the reduced image to a new folder in your catalog, e.g. `LeftArm/Forearm/WristHorse`. 

For each individual mole in a constellation:

1. Take the original 'detail image' from the constellation
2. Use Skitch on the iPhone to draw an arrow to the mole
3. Use SimpleResize on the iPhone to reduce the image size to something managable.
4. Use Dropbox on the iPhone to upload the reduced image to a new folder in the constellation, e.g. `LeftArm/Forearm/WristHorse/Nose`.
