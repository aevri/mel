Work-in-progress tools to help identify new and changing moles on the skin with
the goal of early detection of melanoma skin cancer.

![Tests](https://github.com/aevri/mel/actions/workflows/main.yml/badge.svg?branch=main)

The [Mayo Clinic][1] says:
> The first melanoma signs and symptoms often are:
>
> - A change in an existing mole
> - The development of a new pigmented or unusual-looking growth on your skin

The [UK National Health Service][2] says:
> The most common sign of melanoma is the appearance of a new mole or a change
> in an existing mole. This can happen anywhere on the body, but the back,
> legs, arms and face are most commonly affected.

To help you identify new and changing moles, the tools enable you to:

1. Maintain a catalog of your moles
2. Record a visual history of each mole

For the catalog to be useful, it must enable you to uniquely distinguish every
mole from the other new and pre-existing moles. To this end you will be able to
assign a name, identifying images and notes for each one.

For the visual history of each mole to be useful, it must enable you to
identify significant differences in moles over time. The tools will help you to
normalise the rotation and centering of your mole images so that they are
easier to compare.
