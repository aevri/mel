Tools to help identify new and changing moles on the skin with the goal of early detection of melanoma skin cancer.

The [Mayo Clinic](1) says:
> The first melanoma signs and symptoms often are:
>
> - A change in an existing mole
> - The development of a new pigmented or unusual-looking growth on your skin

The [UK National Health Service][2] says:
> Don’t try to diagnose yourself - if you notice any unusual or persistent 
changes to your skin it could be a sign of skin cancer, so go and see your 
doctor. It’s probably nothing serious, but if it is skin cancer, finding it early 
makes it easier to treat.

To help you identify new and changing moles, the tools enable you to:

1. Maintain a catalog of your moles
2. Record a visual history of each mole

For the catalog to be useful, it must enable you to uniquely distinguish every mole from the other new and pre-existing moles. To this end you will be able to assign a name, identifying images and notes for each one.

For the visual history of each mole to be useful, it must enable you to identify significant differences in moles over time. The tools will help you to normalise the rotation and centering of your mole images so that they are easier to compare.

Catalog design
--------------

Important features:

- Enables determining if a particular mole is new
- Enables identifying moles missed in a previous attempt to catalog
- Easy to explore by browsing files on disk with commonly available tools

Properties to capture:

- Location on body
- Any requirement for assistance to capture
- Dated images to help identify the particular mole
- Visual history of the mole
- Any textual notes about the mole
- A short name for the mole

A simplified anatomy for approximately identifying mole locations with commonly used terms:

- Head
- Neck
- Trunk
  - Thorax
  - Abdomen
- Arms
  - Upper arm
  - Forearm
  - Hand
- Buttocks
- Legs
  - Thigh
  - Below knee
  - Foot
