TODO list
=========

A simple list to capture outstanding tasks, roughly in priority order.

* Add review stage after micro capture. This will speed up the case where a
  picture needs to be rejected. This will also reduce mistakes during batch
  capturing, where the previous mole may be accidentally re-captured as it is
  already in the expected place.

* Display constellation image when doing micro capture, this removes the need
  to manually browse to it.
